// Loads the body of any Markdown page this site can navigate to, keyed by
// the same `source` string nav.generated.ts's searchIndex entries carry
// (e.g. "docs/foo.md", "README.md", "core/README.md").
//
// docs-content.generated.ts is produced by scripts/generate-nav.mjs (see its
// "doc content manifest" section) as a static map of per-file `import()`
// calls — deliberately not Vite's `import.meta.glob()`, which has no
// equivalent under webpack (the stack/next/ surface) and threw a runtime
// "{}.glob is not a function" there. Both Vite and webpack code-split plain,
// literal `import()` calls natively, so this works identically on both.
